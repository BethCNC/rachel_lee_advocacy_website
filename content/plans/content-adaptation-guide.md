We LEARN you, and strive to guide you to people, answers and care you can trust."

UMI Original: "What conditions do you care for? Many! We don't care for conditions, we care for people and the body's that call them home... we are particularly known for our knowledge and ability to care for complex and multi system conditions that are most often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Conditions like Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, Fibromyalgia, or bizarre expression of sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis."

Rachel Lee Adaptation: Condition Card: "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS): A group of inherited disorders that affect connective tissues — primarily skin, joints, and blood vessel walls. People with EDS typically have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin. This can lead to frequent dislocations, chronic pain, and complications in multiple body systems."
