Patient Advocacy Consulting

What is Patient Advocacy?
Patient Advocacy has many hats in the medical community, and many incredible people dedicate hours of their day to these general services.

Patient Advocacy Consulting at Umi is different. Here, we aren't just navigating insurance paperwork or recommending the first doctor on our list. We LEARN you, and strive to guide you to people, answers and care you can trust.

We'll start with a medical history and life history oriented around your needs and goals. We will listen to your story and help you feel seen and heard, so you can listen to your own body clearly and BELIEVE what you hear.

Then, we will help guide you to people, answers, and care you can trust. But we don't stope here. We will work with you before each new appointment to track symptoms, process possible outcomes and treatments, and prepare notes for you to take with you so you can REMEMBER what you want to say.

Not only do we train for this, and study avidly to stay current on as many traditional, integrative and alternative options as we can we:

When you leave the doctor's office feeling small, insignificant and confused, wishing you had remembered that one question or wondering if it is your fault that they can't figure out what's going on, Umi advocates are there to help you stand tall again. Or sit, or lay down! With pride and peace.

Can you still help with paperwork?
Yes. We do everything else you have heard patient advocates do! But when we find you a physician we will vet them ahead of time concerning your condition and needs, study ways to best communicate with them as another unique individual in a complex process, help prepare you for the visit, and follow up after words to pursue your satisfaction and make sure your needs have actually been met.

When we organize physician notes will pay close attention to errors, signs of possible misunderstanding, and even outright differences between your experience and that of the physician so you don't have to spend a minute more than necessary with someone who isn't truly listening to you.

We do all this and SO much more within the freedom of our private membership association. Our advocates will create space for you to process your fears, anxiety, and concerns with thoughtfulness. They can also be a sounding board for your own process and creative ideas without consequences to your overall care.

The Umi Purpose
Knowing yourself and your body isn't a privilege others should have while you are forced to observe from a distance. It is a gift to be loved, treasured and enjoyed. To be known by you.

# Care Coordination Services

## What is Care Coordination?

Care coordination is essential in today's complex healthcare system, and many patient advocates focus primarily on paperwork and administrative tasks.

**My approach to care coordination is different.** I don't just handle insurance forms or refer you to the first specialist on a list. I take the time to understand your unique situation and connect you with providers, treatments, and resources you can trust.

## How Care Coordination Works

### Step 1: Comprehensive Assessment

We begin with a thorough review of your medical history and personal goals. I listen carefully to your story, helping you feel truly seen and heard. This process empowers you to trust your own experiences and advocate for yourself effectively.

### Step 2: Personalized Care Plan

Based on your assessment, I develop a customized care coordination plan that addresses your specific needs. This includes:

- Identifying appropriate specialists and healthcare providers
- Researching treatment options tailored to your conditions
- Creating a roadmap for navigating your healthcare journey

### Step 3: Appointment Preparation & Support

Before each medical appointment, I help you:
- Track and document your symptoms
- Prepare questions and talking points
- Understand potential treatment options
- Create concise notes to bring with you

### Step 4: Follow-Up & Ongoing Support

After appointments, I:
- Review physician notes for accuracy and completeness
- Identify any misunderstandings or discrepancies
- Help you understand next steps and treatment plans
- Provide emotional support and practical guidance

## Benefits of Professional Care Coordination

- **Reduced Stress:** Navigate complex healthcare systems with confidence
- **Better Communication:** Express your concerns clearly to healthcare providers
- **Improved Care:** Receive appropriate treatment from knowledgeable specialists
- **Empowerment:** Develop self-advocacy skills for long-term health management
- **Comprehensive Support:** Address both medical and emotional aspects of your healthcare journey

## My Care Coordination Philosophy

I believe that understanding your own body and health shouldn't be a privilege reserved for medical professionals while you observe from a distance. It's your right to be an informed, active participant in your healthcare decisions.

With professional care coordination, you can transform challenging healthcare experiences into opportunities for empowerment and improved wellbeing.
