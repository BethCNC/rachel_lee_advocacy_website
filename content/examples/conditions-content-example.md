What conditions do you care for? Many! We don't care for conditions, we care for people and the body's that call them home. While we can inspire you with wellness coaching, fitness, nutrition and unique classes that grow and shape you inside and out, we are particularly known for our knowledge and ability to care for complex and multi system conditions that are most often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Conditions like Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, Fibromyalgia, or bizarre expression of sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis.

Medical conditions like connective tissue disorders and fibromyalgia can have very mild expression, or advance suddenly and take the patient by surprise. If you are coming to us in one of these surprises our Navigator's will connect you with an advocacy consultant as quickly as possible. If you are in-between knowing and not knowing, we are here for you right were you are and will help get you where you need to be.

What about my anxiety? I have PTSD from how I've been treated by the medical community. You're not alone. This is a safe place. Not only will you find a community full of kindred spirits working towards their own recovery, from medical trauma to physical, psychological trauma, and more, you will find Joy. We will be networking with wonderful Mental Health Providers to grow a group of counselors who know what you're going through almost, or just as well as, you do. We're also setting up community trauma recovery programs where you can process your story through writing, art, movement or meditation and prayer, and begin to heal on your own gentle terms.

# Understanding Complex Conditions

## My Approach to Complex Conditions

I don't just focus on conditions—I focus on the whole person living with them. My expertise lies in supporting individuals with complex, multi-system conditions that are frequently misdiagnosed or misunderstood by traditional healthcare providers.

As a patient advocate, I specialize in helping people navigate the challenges of conditions such as:

## Common Conditions

### Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)

![EDS illustration](placeholder-for-eds-image.jpg)

**What is EDS?**
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of inherited disorders that affect connective tissues—primarily skin, joints, and blood vessel walls. People with EDS typically have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Joint hypermobility
- Frequent dislocations or subluxations
- Chronic pain
- Skin that bruises easily
- Digestive issues
- Cardiovascular complications
- Fatigue and poor stamina

**Advocacy Challenges:**
- Often takes 10+ years to receive proper diagnosis
- Requires coordination between multiple specialists
- Symptoms frequently dismissed as anxiety or psychosomatic
- Limited treatment options covered by insurance

### Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)

**What is MCAS?**
Mast Cell Activation Syndrome is a condition where mast cells release excessive amounts of chemical mediators, causing allergy-like symptoms and inflammation throughout the body.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Skin reactions (hives, flushing, itching)
- Gastrointestinal issues
- Respiratory problems
- Cardiovascular symptoms
- Neurological symptoms
- Anaphylaxis in severe cases

**Advocacy Challenges:**
- Limited awareness among healthcare providers
- Difficult to diagnose with standard testing
- Symptoms often attributed to anxiety
- Requires complex medication management

### Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

![POTS illustration](placeholder-for-pots-image.jpg)

**What is POTS?**
POTS is a form of dysautonomia that affects blood flow. Upon standing, people with POTS experience an abnormal increase in heart rate, often accompanied by a range of symptoms.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Rapid heartbeat upon standing
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fainting or near-fainting
- Brain fog and difficulty concentrating
- Fatigue
- Exercise intolerance
- Blood pooling in extremities

**Advocacy Challenges:**
- Often misdiagnosed as anxiety or deconditioning
- Limited treatment options
- Requires lifestyle modifications
- Symptoms fluctuate, making documentation difficult

## Comorbidity Connections

Many complex conditions don't exist in isolation. Understanding how these conditions interact is crucial for effective treatment and management.

![Comorbidity Map](placeholder-for-comorbidity-map.jpg)

**Common Connections:**
- EDS often co-occurs with POTS and MCAS (the "Trifecta")
- Fibromyalgia frequently overlaps with chronic fatigue syndrome
- Autoimmune conditions often cluster together
- Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression commonly develop secondary to chronic physical conditions

## Medical Trauma and Advocacy

Many individuals with complex conditions have experienced medical trauma from:
- Being dismissed or not believed by healthcare providers
- Receiving incorrect diagnoses for years
- Being told symptoms are "all in your head"
- Undergoing unnecessary treatments or procedures

**How I Help:**
- Validate your experiences and symptoms
- Prepare you for medical appointments to reduce anxiety
- Connect you with providers who understand complex conditions
- Provide emotional support throughout your healthcare journey
- Empower you with knowledge about your conditions

## Patient Stories

### Sarah's Journey with EDS

"For years, doctors told me I was just double-jointed and that my pain was from anxiety. After seeing 12 different specialists, I still didn't have answers. Working with Rachel changed everything. She helped me find a knowledgeable geneticist, prepared me for my appointment, and supported me through the diagnosis process. Now I have proper treatment for my EDS and finally feel validated."

### Michael's Experience with POTS

"When I developed POTS after a viral infection, I was told to just drink more water and exercise. My symptoms continued to worsen until I could barely stand without fainting. Rachel helped me document my symptoms properly and connected me with a dysautonomia specialist. With proper treatment, I've been able to return to work part-time and regain some quality of life."
