But this isn’t how we are made to live. The majority of our nervous system from spinal column to the beautiful swaths of fascia around each organ and tissue, is designed to communicate with us in a language beyond words. We are made to know ourselves.",
      "At Umi our mission is to honor the mind, body and spirit of each unique member as a path healing and wholeness is established together with a diverse community of like-minded people. To lay a foundation for changing the paradigm of how we live, listen and communicate about our health FIRST with ourselves and then with family, physicians and beyond. It starts here.",
      "In the Umi space we will be healing together. Integrating the necessary elements of medical care and awareness for chronic, multi-system conditions and disorders with a wide variety of classes, therapies and community programs to custom build what you need to create and maintain stability meaningfully and personally. And for those with wonderful health, we will join you in your endeavor to continue knowing yourself and living the life you long for with mind, body and spirit as one.",

      "What conditions do you care for?  Many! We don’t care for conditions, we care for people and the body’s that call them home.  While we can inspire you with wellness coaching, fitness, nutrition and unique classes that grow and shape you inside and out, we are particularly known for our knowledge and ability to care for complex and multi system conditions that are most often misdiagnosed and misunderstood.  Conditions like Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, Fibromyalgia, or bizarre expression of sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "Medical conditions like connective tissue disorders and fibromyalgia can have very mild expression, or advance suddenly and take the patient by surprise. If you are coming to us in one of these surprises our Navigator’s will connect you with an advocacy consultant as quickly as possible. If you are in-between knowing and not knowing, we are here for you right were you are and will help get you where you need to be.",
      "Can my family come too? Absolutely. Many challenges to our wellness are hereditary and we understand that one of the biggest fears of a parent is “What if my children or loved ones have this?” Bring your spouse, your partner, your caregivers. The space is for children, too (we’ll have ours there!), where they can meet with other kids with shared experiences, or a compassionate mentor to help them talk through what it means to have a chronic condition and still find joy in life. Our special family days will allow mamas and daddies to get care peacefully while children play and learn with one of our talented teachers and do art, breathe work, reading games, movement fun, gardening and so much more.",
      "I don’t think I have complex condition but I’m looking something different for my health and community. Can I join? Yes! We are passionate about sustaining health and being with you whether you are struggling in mind, body or spirit, or just need the kind of community where you can feel heard, respected and supported as a whole person. We believe in healing the disconnect between our bodies and sense of self that is so subconsciously perpetuated in modern medicine. That you must only observe yourself while others have the privilege of knowing and understanding you, and telling you what to do about it.",
      "Umi can be a place for you to BE, care for yourself and your family, friends, children or pets, and feel your best affordably and meaningfully.",
      "What about my anxiety? I have PTSD from how I’ve been treated by the medical community. You’re not alone. This is a safe place. Not only will you find a community full of kindred spirits working towards their own recovery, from medical trauma to physical, psychological trauma, and more, you will find Joy. We will be networking with wonderful Mental Health Providers to grow a group of counselors who know what you’re going through almost, or just as well as, you do.  We’re also setting up community trauma recovery programs where you can process your story through writing, art, movement or meditation and prayer, and begin to heal on your own gentle terms.",
      "My medical care is a mess, papers everywhere, so much testing and lab work. I don’t know how to handle it all. I’m scared that if people knew all the things that I’ve been through that they’ll think I’m making this up! We’ve been there too. We’re partnering with Rachel Lee Patient Advocacy to train skilled patient advocates who know the nuances of your condition(s), and community Navigators who will be able to help organize your medical history, put together the big picture, and even come with you to appointments at the Center and help take notes, recall all the questions you want to ask, and then sit with you afterwards to process what needs to be done.",
      "What is a Private Membership Association (PMA)?  A PMA is a unique, unincorporated business model that allows for incredible creativity, free will and service for its members. It is completely in the private sphere and as such can be designed based on REAL NEEDS rather than beurocracy.  Think of Umi a bit like an exclusive club. But instead of charging you like a fancy club, we are using this special model to keep our costs lower than is possible with other business models, while raising the standard of care beyond excellence and into the realm of personal, unique neeeds of overlooked and marginalized communities. The PMA community is maintained by a trustee or trustees who are members, and services are provided by other members of that same community.",
      "When you join Umi, you affirm as a private individual, with inalienable rights protected by the Constitution and our legal advocacy team the following: 1. your right to chose your own medical care. 2. The right to choose your own treatment plan and modalities. 3. Your right to choose your own providers to meet these needs.",
      "What does it cost? Our membership fee is small, and lasts a lifetime. No monthly or even annual fees that you do not choose. Our offerings are available as needed, or as a part of a variety of subscriptions that allow for discounted services throughout the entire center. You can choose a predesigned bundle, or work with a Navigator to create specialty subscriptions built around what you specifically need NOW that will allow you to get the care you need right away, and also have time to pay for it.  We will not be in network with insurance companies, but we will provide superbills for services your insurance covers, and support to help you learn to file with your insurance company. We never want cost to be the reason you can’t have the help you need. Visit our How Umi Works page for details on membership!",
      "I’m in a financial crisis from health, or caring for someone with many needs and we can’t afford anything right now. We want to help. Let us know what you are going through honestly and we will do everything we can to give you support to get better. Why? Because we believe in what we’re offering!  Let us help you get stable so that you can go back to work, or find a new job you can love that doesn’t compromise you’re health.  And if that isn’t enough, we are developing a special Umi Care Fund for the men, women, and children who need it most. For those who qualify for severe financial distress and below poverty income, you may apply for support from this fund and receive the services you need to help get out of crisis and improve you’re quality of life. For more details call us today.",

      "Favorite Quotes:",
      "",
      "“The very essence of playfulness is an openness to anything that may happen, the feeling that whatever happens, it’s okay… you’re either free to play, or you’re not.”",
      "– John Cleese",
      "Meet Founder & Director Rachel Lee!",
      "Rachel Lee Davis is both director and co-founder of the Umi Wellness Center. She brings a bounty of experience from nonprofit leadership, higher educational administration, and entrepreneurship. She is also hEDS patient, caregiver, and advocate.",
      "Rachel will continue to see clients as a patient advocate for the most complicated disorders while training a team of advocates to dedicatedly serve the Umi community. She is also becomming a certified movement intelligence instructor with      Bones for Life(R), and will soon be a PhD student in Developmental Psychology. Rachel’s pet program is the Umi Moves offerings at the center, she hopes you’ll join her!, and dance classes in a variety of foci through the center and sharing constantly about the incredible gifts and passions of her fellow providers.",
      "Rachel holds a master’s degree from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (GCTS) and two undergraduate degrees including Elementary Education, and a master certificate in One-Room School Education. She did her masters research overseas as a guest-researcher of the American University in Cairo with mentors from Emory University as well as AUC and GCTS for her groundbreaking work in somatic communication theory and embodied cognition. Prior to this she studied dance, choreography and dance education at a community college while completing her elementary education practicums through classroom teaching, international youth groups, and running a dance education program at the local YMCA.",
      "In 2019, Rachel’s research was abruptly cut short by A severe flare in symptoms that had been slowly progressing for some time. Doctors advised her to return to the U.S. urgently, where she spent a year discovering and fighting for an hEDS diagnosis. Her many rare co-conditions that make her a part of the Zebra community provided ample opportunity to learn about the blessings of good medical care, and also its trials. She began applying her work in non-verbal communication to better understand how to vet her physicians and navigate the system responsible, not only for her own well-being, but also for both children who are also on the hypermobility spectrum.",
      "Rachel’s tenacity for this work and for making medical jargon, treatments, diagnostic requirements and policies understandable and accessible to other patients in this community led to founding Rachel Lee Patient Advocacy Consulting, LLC in 2021. At RLPAC Rachel serves clients as a patient advocacy consultant and volunteers for community EDS advocacy on a daily basis among the teachers, doctors and parents she encounters and through social media groups online. But ultimately this is not enough.",
      "Rachel believes passionately that patients need and deserve to fully understand their medical condition and co-conditions, and the options available to them, not just the preferences of a any one physician. she believes that the truly excellent doctors, nurses, therapists and other clinicians also need the support of advocates in order to make a dent in the unreasonably challenging world that is multisystemic disorders. She, and close friends from both sides of this world, have come together to found a different kind of community to fill this gap. A community that can truly embody what it means to heal together.",
      "Rachel loves to kayak, ice skate, teach her children, and play with their adorable poodle Ellie. She is a proud Autistic woman, abuse survivor, and loving wife and mother. She hopes to foster and intensely protect the habitat of Umi Wellness Center as a safe and inspiring community for other survivors and neurodivergent individuals, as well as those who need a place to abide, rest and recovery from medical trauma and complex conditions. She is also the first person who will remind you to have fun.",
      "Favorite Quotes:",
      "",
      "“Rebellion is when you look society in the face and say, I understand who you want me to be. but I am going to show you who I am.”",
      "– Anthony Anaxagorou",
      "Catherine Ruffin – Cat has taken a medical leave to care for urgent personal issues and those of her children. We are grateful for her contributions and continued advocacy for our center within the EDS and MCAS community.",
      "Catherine is raising a new generation with her partner while working on her first novel and holds a degree in Psychology from Appalachian State University. She has also obtained training and certifications in various fields such as nursing, computer software, and family-centered community support.",
      "With Umi she hopes to focus on patient advocacy and care coordination as it relates to people with chronic and complex illnesses in the absence of acute status. Cat’s years of trying to connect the dots has illuminated her own needs just as brightly as those of all the individuals in her community experiencing a lack within current systems.",
      "Facilitating connection and innovation spurs her in this new direction with U/mi Wellness Center and she cannot wait to share that with you!",

      "Patient Advocacy Consulting at Umi is different. Here, we aren’t just navigating insurance paperwork or recommending the first doctor on our list. We LEARN you, and strive to guide you to people, answers and care you can trust.",
      "We’ll start with a medical history and life history oriented around your needs and goals. We will listen to your story and help you feel seen and heard, so you can listen to your own body clearly and BELIEVE what you hear.",
      "Then, we will help guide you to people, answers, and care you can trust. But we don’t stope here. We will work with you before each new appointment to track symptoms, process possible outcomes and treatments, and prepare notes for you to take with you so you can REMEMBER what you want to say.",

Or sit, or lay down! With pride and peace.",
      "",
      "Yes. We do everything else you have heard patient advocates do! But when we find you a physician we will vet them ahead of time concerning your condition and needs, study ways to best communicate with them as another unique individual in a complex process, help prepare you for the visit, and follow up after words to pursue your satisfaction and make sure your needs have actually been met.",
      "When we organize physician notes will pay close attention to errors, signs of possible misunderstanding, and even outright differences between your experience and that of the physician so you don’t have to spend a minute more than necessary with someone who isn’t truly listening to you.",
      "We do all this and SO much more within the freedom of our private membership association. Our advocates will create space for you to process your fears, anxiety, and concerns with thoughtfulness. They can also be a sounding board for your own process and creative ideas without consequences to your overall care.",

      "“I’ve tried using food journals in the past and it has ended poorly – mental health, physically, and emotionally. But this time, trying a food journal, I have learned a lot about my eating patterns and how my body reacts to things. I am excited to continue learning on how to find stability and keep learning about what works best for my whole person.And I am very excited to follow up with my first doctor’s appointment, getting some calls and appointments from referrals to some different specialists. It is encouraging to see and feel progress.”",

      "During this segment we will be answering some questions about how you prepare for your first doctor’s appointment with a Patient Advocate. How do you prep? What can we do to help make you more confident going into your appointment?Continuing on this health journey, we hope this gives you an idea of what Umi can do for you. For making your health and wellness be a part of you, a part of your daily life instead of separate.",
      "“I feel confident that even if there is no diagnosis in the foreseeable future, I will find answers! It has been such a change to feel supported and seen during this process. This was just the first doctor’s appointment! Looking towards the next ones feeling supported and now confident in communicating my needs!”",

      "How silly is it, that beauty of words have been reduced to algorithms on a web page. Then, humans, we go and translate those “rithms” into our lives and relationships as though they have real meaning. *sigh.* But the codes and content rules, algos and the SEO analysis, it all keeps us painfully distant while feeling like we are connected.",

The first post is meaningless because compared to the reality, compared to what is to come, compared to the incredible PEOPLE here at Umi and those still finding us, this post is going to fade. And the more we try to make what was first be first, last and EVERYTHING in between. Well. The more of the story we are going to miss!",

      "“I’ve tried using food journals in the past and it has ended poorly – mental health, physically, and emotionally. But this time, trying a food journal, I have learned a lot about my eating patterns and how my body reacts to things. I am excited to continue learning on how to find stability and keep learning about what works best for my whole person.And I am very excited to follow up with my first doctor’s appointment, getting some calls and appointments from referrals to some different specialists. It is encouraging to see and feel progress.”",

Then, humans, we go and translate those “rithms” into our lives and relationships as though they have real meaning. *sigh.* But the codes and content rules, algos and the SEO analysis, it all keeps us painfully distant while feeling like we are connected.",

The first post is meaningless because compared to the reality, compared to what is to come, compared to the incredible PEOPLE here at Umi and those still finding us, this post is going to fade.

      "This blog’s job is to fade into the background. It will drift out to sea on the foam, like the Little Mermaid when her heart was broken. But unlike hans Christian Anderson’s character, this article won’t fade because our hearts are broken but because they are so FULL!  and ready to join the magnificent waves of a new adventure.",
