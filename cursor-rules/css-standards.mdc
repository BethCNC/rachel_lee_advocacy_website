# CSS Standards for Rachel Lee Advocacy Website

## Established CSS Values - DO NOT CHANGE

### Typography System
The typography system has been established in `typography.css` with classes that match the Figma design specifications. These values are now locked and should be used consistently across the application.

```css
/* Use typography classes from typography.css */
.heading-heading-7xl {...}
.heading-heading-6xl {...}
/* and so on */

/* DO NOT create new typography styles or modify existing ones */
```

### Design Tokens
The design tokens are established in `variables.css` and include:

1. **Colors**
   - Brand colors
   - Semantic colors
   - System colors

2. **Spacing**
   - Consistent spacing scales

3. **Shadows**
   - Defined elevation levels

```css
/* Always use CSS variables for design values */
color: var(--color-brand-primary);
margin: var(--spacing-md);
box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm);

/* DO NOT use hardcoded values */
```

### CSS Architecture
The CSS is organized as follows:
- `variables.css` - Global design tokens
- `typography.css` - Typography classes
- `App.css` - Global styles and utilities
- Component-specific CSS files - For component styling

## CSS Coding Standards

1. **Use established classes and variables**
   - For typography, use the typography classes
   - For colors, spacing, and other design tokens, use CSS variables

2. **Component styling**
   - Each component should have its own CSS file
   - Use BEM naming convention
   - Avoid deep nesting

3. **Responsive design**
   - Use mobile-first approach
   - Utilize the defined breakpoints in variables.css

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
   - Provide focus states
   - Support reduced motion preferences

## Making Changes
If you believe a change to the established CSS system is necessary:
1. Document the proposed change and rationale
2. Get approval from the design team
3. Update both the CSS and this documentation

DO NOT modify the core CSS variables or typography classes without this process.
